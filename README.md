# recschemes

These are code samples for my recursion schemes blog posts.

The literate Org files are stored in `/org`. The Haskell files here
are checked in for your convenience but are generated from the Org files.

To render a file to GFM+footnotes, run `./ghost FILE`. org-babel generates Haskell source.
