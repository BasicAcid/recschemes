# recschemes

These are code samples for my recursion schemes blog posts.

The literate Org files are stored in `/org`. The Haskell files here
are checked in for your convenience but are generated from the Org files.

To render a file to GFM+footnotes, run `./ghost FILE`. org-babel generates Haskell source.

The generated code samples in `src/` are licensed under the Solopsistic Public License, or the Unlicense. All rights to the blog entries in `org/` are reserved; you may not copy or alter their text.
